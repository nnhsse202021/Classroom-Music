# Classroom-Music
The Classroom Music web server is made to allow a teacher to play a playlist of songs as chosen by their students. As it is right now, has three different views: the sign-in, teacher, and student views. Each one serves a different function in playing music in the classroom.

## Sign-In
The sign-in is simple -- its singular purpose is to guide students and teachers to their respective views.

## Student View
The student view is a bit more complex. Currently, it  allows a student to search for a song(through YouTube) and add it to the playlist in the teacher view. It also gives them a sign out button that brings them back to the sign-in page. After searching for a song and locating it, the student is told to verify that the song is clean.

## Teacher View
The teacher view has the most detail. Not only does it have all the elements of the student view, but also allows for control over the playlist itself. The teacher can play the songs in the playlist in their given order, skip them if they find them to be inappropriate or too long, and can summon a list of all the songs within the playlist. In the situation that the teacher needs to erase the playlist, such as when a new one is needed for a different set of students, they can click the clear playlist button, which will reset the playlist entirely.
